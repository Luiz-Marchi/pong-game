# Classic Pong game
    
The first game of my life, although simple, was very challenging because I had to learn a new language (C#) and a game engine (Unity).

controls:
W and S to control the left paddle
UpArrow and DownArrow to control the right paddle
Enter to activate the A.I (right paddle only)
